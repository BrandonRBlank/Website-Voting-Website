                        Like all natural processes, flying private jets increases entropy in the universe because it is an inefficient process.  For example, upon running into flocks of birds, the jet engines may become clogged, thus reducing overall performance of the aircraft for a given energy input.  <b>Any energy not used for moving the aircraft is converted to heat, which quickly diffuses across the planet's surface.</b>  In addition, jet engines produce a myriad of poisonous chemicals, many of which act as the glass in a greenhouse and <b>prevent heat from escaping into space.</b>

                    <h3>Driving Your Car</h3>
                    <p>
                        While driving erratically, a famous motorist recently told another, "Get off the [expletive] road you [expletive] [expletive]!!!!!"  This is a profound statement, as it has a number of implications:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The increase in the level of carbon dioxide in the troposphere has been so profound that it is increasing irritability in motorists.</li>
                        <li>Other poisonous gasses are being emitted by the rest of the vehicles on the road.  This is reducing the ability of the frustrated motorist to drive in a straight line and speak properly.</li>
                        <li>Climate change deniers will not deny that the climate is not changing.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Despite the fact that carbon dioxide takes longer to heat, it also acts as insulation which <b>traps heat in the troposphere.</b>  In addition, the other poisonous gasses are inhibiting plant growth.  Plants rely on photosynthesis, <b>an endothermic process,</b> to gain energy.  When there are fewer plants, <b>the Earth warms more because of the energy that would have been absorbed by the plants is instead reflected into the atmosphere by the ground.</b>

                        "Stop blaming us for global climate change," cavemen will say.  "We don't use electricity and we eat only what we can gather each day."  However, what they fail to realize is that even the act of living is an exothermic process:  all of their cells release energy during cellular respiration.  In addition to allowing them to keep living, the energy released is used to maintain an internal temperature of 98.6 +/- 1 degrees fahrenheit, <b>which is significantly warmer than the average temperature at the Earth's surface.</b>  The global heating effect is exacerbated by the massive amount of energy they use in trying to acquire food.

Although it may not seem like you can do much, in reality, there are a number of things you can do.  For example, you can attend business seminars detailing climate policy, stop running your home's air conditioning unit, bike to and from work, and lastly, breathe lightly.

                        As stated earlier, while running, air conditioning units contribute to the overall heat content of the planet.  This creates a vicious cycle:  <b>as you use more AC, you require more AC to keep the inside of your home cool because of the hotter outside air.</b>  Given enough time, this will <b>greatly increase Earth's surface temperature.</b>

                        Gas-powered automobiles are highly inefficient in converting gasoline to usable energy, and this inefficiency results in a <b>large net increase in the thermal energy content of the environment.</b>  Biking, on the other hand, is quite efficient:  <b>you waste very little energy to move the bike from point A to point B.</b>  Additionally, because other vehicles move more quickly than you, you are less likely to road rage; as one biker puts it, "That [expletive] got away!"

                        If you become mortally wounded, EMS will burn gas in order to take you to a local hospital.  This will contribute to the overall heat content on Earth.

                    <h3>Breathe Lightly</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is perhaps the most effective way to reduce carbon dioxide and increase oxygen levels in the atmosphere.  The logic is quite simple:  when you breathe, you inhale oxygen.  During cellular respiration, <b>the oxygen you breathe is absorbed into your bloodstream, thus reducing the oxygen levels in the atmosphere.</b>  At the same time, carbon dioxide and water are exhaled, <b>thus increasing the atmosphere's level of carbon dioxide.</b>  Breathing lightly enables you to reduce your consumption of oxygen and expulsion of carbon dioxide.  While this may be may be uncomfortable or difficult to do at first, there are a number of factors that will make this easier over time:

                        <li>Weakening of the nerves that control breathing.  When this happens, you will feel less of an urge to breathe.</li>
                        <li>Changes in blood chemistry.  Higher levels of carbon dioxide increase the acidity of your bloodstream.  However, over time, the carbonic acid in your blood will fall out of solution, thus increasing the pH to normal levels, <b>thus reducing discomfort.</b></li>
                        <li>Evolution.  Over many years, the human race will evolve ways of coping with lower blood oxygen levels and higher CO2 levels.</li>

                        Low blood oxygen levels can lead to hypoxia, which may be fatal if prolonged.  Be sure to have another individual present when performing this task.
